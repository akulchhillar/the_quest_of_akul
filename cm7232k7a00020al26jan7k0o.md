A couple of weeks back I bought this book “[Don’t sweat the small stuff](https://www.amazon.in/DONT-SWEAT-SMALL-STUFF-ITS/dp/0786881852)“ from the annual book fair that was held in Delhi in 2025. I was hooked on to this book the moment I read a few pages in when I picked it up from the stall.

Here are a few things that I have picked up from the book and things that made me reflect back on my life. (This list might be updated when I revisit this book in future)

* Your life will never be perfect rather it’s the pursuit of making it perfect. The ability to accept that things will never be perfect is more liberating than scary
    
* You will always have something or the other to complete. The “to-do” list will always have something in it and that should be fine. You have to select a few things in your life and prioritize them, running after getting all the tasks completed is not only exhaustive but also takes away everyhting else from you.
    
* Try to have a “patience period” in your day where you don’t react to things that annoy you rather you just let them be. Start with just 5 mins a day and then as you get comfortable with this, increase the time bit by bit.
    
* Whenever you face any problem, don’t jumpt to solving it, rather let it remain in your mind & do something else. The idea is to let your sub-conscious min work in the background to find a solution for it.
    
* Spend some quality time with your thoughts. It’s okay to get bored with your thoughts for some time becasuse we when you are bored, your mind comes up with innovative solutions to your problems.
    
    Plus it also allows you to reflect back on your life and help you to change your perspective.
    
* <mark>Your home is wherever you are</mark>. You take your mindset where ever you go. If you are pessimist then no matter where you are, you will find people meeting your view.
    
    You always live up to the opinion of what you think the other person has of you.
    
* Whenever you feel low, remeber that it too shall pass. Like you good ays, you bad days too shall pass.
    
    <mark>Be graceful towards your low days and grateful for your good days.</mark>
    

These are a few things that I found worth rememebring and taking notes of, I am sure when I reveist this book, I would edit this list or my views on the above mentioned points would change.

To the future self, learn to live and don’t be harsh on yourself.

# Why I started this blog ?

Well, franly speaking, **_I don't know_**.

I mean, I started writing blogs, or at least I tried writing blogs a couple of times in the past as well. However, every time I started writing eventually I would lose all the motivation and then stop writing more of those.

I think one of the reasons was that I would burden myself with a schedule and a timeline of writing every week.
I know this may sound counter-intuitive as having a schedule makes it more likely that I would follow up with my habit but in my case, I felt that it kind of forced me to write every week, and this lead to a sharp decline in my motivation to continue further.

The other reason why I did not continue my blog previously was that I am, like everybody else, someone who likes to enjoy consuming content rather than producing content.
I like to read but since my childhood, I was not good at writing stuff.

However, like every other motivational story where the protagonist of the film does not give up, I am back.
And this time I would try to not repeat the same mistakes that I had committed previously.

The whole idea of re-starting this blog is for me to become a better writer and more importantly become better at explaining my points to others because I believe that no matter what line of work you are in if you can't communicate or explain your ideas in your head, you are going to have a hard time.

Anyhow, enough of my blabbering. I think it's time I call it a day.

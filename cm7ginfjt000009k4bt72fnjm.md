Well, have you ever thought about how you learn stuff? Not actually learning somehing rather thinking about how you actually learn, going meta here.

With being someone who was average to below average in school to someone who is a self taught programmer, I have a few things to share about the process of learning.

## Learn from multiple sources

This might be a little counter-intitutive advice, it makes more sense to focus on learning from 1 specific source instead of learning it from different sources.

However, I have realized that learning about a thing from multiple sources allows you to gain different perspective on the same topic and thus helping you gain a better understaning of the fundamental concepts.

Whenever I am learning about anything, I refer to the topic from various sources giving me a comprehensve understanding of the topic.

Although, before jumping to multiple sources, I make sure to develop a rock solid understanding from one source and I often revist this source whenever I am lost.

## Repetitive Spaced Learning

In case you are unaware of this amazing tool, you are missing out on a lot.

Repetitive spaced learning is a proven method to improve your memory and retrival. The idea is that instead of learning about a thing and then going for a recall it’s far better to learn about something and then after a few days you should try to recall the content.

This will allow your brain to form stronger connections with the learning material and will make it easier for your brain to recal the content later.

Whenever I have to comit to something in my long term memory, I use this technique to cement the ideas in my head. Though it’s a slow process, but if you want to rember something for a longer period of time, then it’s the most efficient method.

## Deliberate Practice

I first came across this term in a [blog](https://fs.blog/what-is-deliberate-practice/) by Farnam Street and boy my mind was blown by it.

Whenver we are practising anything, after getting comfortable with the material out subconsciou mind kicks in and takes over as that activity becomes second nature.

However, this is where our learning stops, instead of just doing things without a conscious thought we let our auto-pilot mode take over and thus making it difficult to learn about the topic at hand.

Rather whenver we are in learning anything, we should make sure that we are consciously paying attention to task at hand. And we should have a deliberate goal in mind before we even begin with the session.

With a dedicated time, learning grows exponentially.

## Goldilock Zone

Your goal should be slightly outside your comfor zone, to make you go for it.

However, you have to be smart with setting this zone for yourself, because if the goal is beyond your current skillset then chances are that you would give up on the activity and if the goal is below your current skillset then you would not pay attention while working on it.

Thus, it should be slightly outside of your comfort zone so that it keeps your hungry and makes you go for it.

Well, these are a few tips that I have for anyone who wants to improve their learning habits.

This is strictly based on my experience and is mere suggestion, it’s on the reader’s to figure out what works for him or what does not.
